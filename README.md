# To_Do-App-Task
This was my first practical project with Odoo — a simple training application designed to learn the Odoo environment
and apply the fundamentals of module development and integration. The app includes Tree View, Form View,
and Search View for displaying, adding, and editing tasks, with support for basic task categorization. It helped me
gain hands‑on experience in creating models and modules from scratch, setting up Odoo, configuring the development
environment, and understanding the module installation and lifecycle within Odoo.
Technical Outcomes:
• Configured core system components such as: __manifest__.py, __init__.py, lunch.json.
• Created model access rights file: ir.model.access.csv.
• Worked with relational fields like many2one, linking them to res.partner.
• Built multi‑level menus for improved navigation.
